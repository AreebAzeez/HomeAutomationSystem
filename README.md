Home Automation System

A comprehensive home automation system designed to enhance energy efficiency, safety, and user convenience using IoT technologies, Arduino, and NodeMCU.


📜 Project Overview

This project implements a smart home automation system integrating sensors, actuators, and IoT devices. The system enables real-time monitoring and control of home appliances for sustainable energy management and improved user comfort.


✨ Features

Automated Power Management: Optimize energy consumption using sensor-based triggers.

Remote Control: Control appliances via mobile or web apps.

IoT Integration: Utilize NodeMCU for internet-based automation.

Sensor-Based Automation: Automate devices like lights and fans based on environmental conditions.

Safety Mechanisms: Integrate safety features like fire or gas leakage detection.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

1. Install Arduino IDE.
2. Install necessary libraries (e.g., WiFi, MQTT, Adafruit DHT).


Setup

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HomeAutomationSystem.git
cd HomeAutomationSystem


2. Open the .ino files in the src folder with Arduino IDE.


3. Upload the code to the respective boards (Arduino/NodeMCU).


4. Assemble the hardware as per the circuit diagram in docs/circuit_diagram.pdf.


🧪 How It Works

1. Sensors detect environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, motion).

2. NodeMCU communicates with the cloud server for remote access.

3. Appliances are controlled based on sensor data or user inputs.
